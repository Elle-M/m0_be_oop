# Self Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?

I am getting a better general understand that will be refined after reviewing the information. I am started to grasp and retain the information and will continue to do so with ongoing repetition.


- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?

It's feeling a little more routine to take breaks to reset. It improves my quality of understanding and mental clarity.

- What do you need to do to be ready for intense technical lessons and challenges like this, for 6 hours/day next week? What support do you need?

Good calendar, comfortable working environment, yoga, food, sun, excercise, SLEEP, food. The understanding the I am developing aids to help with faster reading due to dyslexia and adhd, outside of medication.
